# Randolio: Gooch Event

**ESX/QB/QBX supported with bridge**

The Gooch random xmas event from GTA online recreated into fivem. All the ptfx, sounds and models were deep searched by moi from 'fm_content_xmas_mugger.c' decompiled code. It will cycle every x amount of minutes and pick a random player on the server to spawn on, will never be the same player as last time. PLEASE look at function canBeChosen(id) in sv_gooch.lua if you wish to add more checks before spawning. If StealPlayersCash = true, it will steal your cash from your pockets or it will just steal your dignity (if you have any left). Chase him, kill him and he'll drop a present. This will return your cash if the option was enabled and will also give additional rewards that YOU define in sv_config.lua.

**Only ox target is currently supported, convert it yourself.**

**I'm unsure on what DLC this was apart of so if it's not working, try bumping your game build up.**
